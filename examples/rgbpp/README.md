- Spore directory: The examples for RGB++ Spore creation, transfer and leap

> [!TIP]
> All the parameters of the examples should be repalced with your own, including BTC private key, CKB private key, BTC Service origin, BTC Service token, BTC UTXO, xUDT type args, Spore type args, etc. Please confirm whether the parameters are correct according to the code comments

## How to Start

### Install dependencies and build packages

```
pnpm install && pnpm build:packages
```
### Update .env

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```shell
cd examples/rgbpp && cp .env.example .env
```

Update the configuration values:

```yaml
# True for CKB and BTC Mainnet and false for CKB and BTC Testnet, the default value is false
IS_MAINNET=false

# CKB Variables

# The CKB secp256k1 private key whose format is 32bytes hex string with 0x prefix
CKB_SECP256K1_PRIVATE_KEY=0x-private-key

# CKB node url which should be matched with IS_MAINNET
CKB_NODE_URL=https://testnet.ckb.dev/rpc

# CKB indexer url which should be matched with IS_MAINNET
CKB_INDEXER_URL=https://testnet.ckb.dev/indexer

# BTC Variables

# The BTC private key whose format is 32bytes hex string without 0x prefix
# The Native Segwit P2WPKH address will be generated with the BTC private key
# Read more about P2WPKH in BIP141: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#p2wpkh
BTC_PRIVATE_KEY=private-key

# The BTC assets api url which should be matched with IS_MAINNET
VITE_BTC_SERVICE_URL=https://btc-assets-api.testnet.mibao.pro;

# The BTC assets api token which should be matched with IS_MAINNET
# To get an access token, please refer to https://github.com/ckb-cell/rgbpp-sdk/tree/develop/packages/service#get-an-access-token
VITE_BTC_SERVICE_TOKEN=;

# The BTC assets api origin which should be matched with IS_MAINNET
VITE_BTC_SERVICE_ORIGIN=https://btc-test.app;
```

## RGB++ xUDT Examples

### RGB++ xUDT Launch on BTC

#### 1. Prepare Launch

> [!TIP]
> Please make sure the CKB private key in the .env is correct

```shell
# Create a CKB empty rgbpp lock cell to launch RGB++ xUDT assets later
npx ts-node xudt/launch/1-prepare-launch.ts
```
#### 2. Launch RGB++ xUDT on BTC

> [!TIP]
> Please make sure the `1-prepare-launch.ts` has been run and the corresponding CKB transaction has been committed

```shell
npx ts-node xudt/launch/2-launch-rgbpp.ts
```

When the command is executed successfully, the **RGB++ Asset type script args** will appear in the output log

#### 3. Distribute RGB++ xUDT on BTC

> [!TIP]
> Please make sure the `2-launch-rgbpp.ts` has been run and the corresponding BTC and CKB transactions have been committed
> The **RGB++ Asset type script args** in the above should be set to the `xudtTypeArgs`

```shell
npx ts-node xudt/launch/3-distribute-rgbpp.ts
```

### RGB++ xUDT Transfer and Leap

#### 1. Leap xUDT from CKB to BTC

```shell
npx ts-node xudt/1-ckb-leap-btc.ts 
```

#### 2. Transfer RGB++ xUDT on BTC with Queue Service

```shell
npx ts-node xudt/2-btc-transfer.ts 
```

#### 3. Leap RGB++ xUDT from BTC to CKB with Queue Service

```shell
npx ts-node xudt/3-btc-leap-ckb.ts 
```

#### 4. Unlock xUDT BTC time cells on CKB

A cron job in RGB++ Queue service will construct a transaction unlocking the mature BTC time cells to the their `target_ckb_address`.

However, you can still manually unlock the spore BTC time cell through the following command

Warning: Wait at least 6 BTC confirmation blocks to unlock the BTC time cells after 3-btc-leap-ckb.ts

```shell
npx ts-node xudt/4-unlock-btc-time.ts 
```

## RGB++ Spore Examples

### RGB++ Spores Launch on BTC

#### 1. Create RGB++ Cluster Cell

> [!TIP]
> Please make sure all the variables in the .env are correct
> The BTC UTXO of `1-prepare-cluster.ts` and `2-create-cluster.ts` should be same

```shell
# Create a CKB empty rgbpp lock cell to create cluster later
npx ts-node spore/launch/1-prepare-cluster.ts

# Create a cluster cell with rgbpp lock
npx ts-node spore/launch/2-create-cluster.ts
```

When the commands are executed successfully, the **clusterId** and **cluster rgbpp lock args** will appear in the output log

#### 2. Create RGB++ Spores with Cluster on BTC

> [!TIP]
> Please make sure the `2-create-cluster.ts` has been run and the corresponding BTC and CKB transactions have been committed
> The **clusterId** in the above should be set to the `clusterId` and the **cluster rgbpp lock args** should be set to the `clusterRgbppLockArgs`

```shell
npx ts-node spore/launch/3-create-spores.ts
```

### Transfer and Leap Spore

#### 1. Transfer RGB++ Spore on BTC with Queue Service

```shell
npx ts-node spore/4-transfer-spore.ts
```

#### 2. Leap RGB++ Spore from BTC to CKB

```shell
npx ts-node spore/5-leap-spore-to-ckb.ts
```

#### 3. Unlock Spore BTC time cells on CKB

A cron job in RGB++ Queue service will construct a transaction unlocking the mature BTC time cells to the their `target_ckb_address`.

However, you can still manually unlock the spore BTC time cell through the following command

**Warning: Wait at least 6 BTC confirmation blocks to unlock the BTC time cells after 5-leap-spore-to-ckb.ts**

```shell
npx ts-node spore/6-unlock-btc-time-cell.ts
```

#### 4. Leap Spore from CKB to BTC

```shell
npx ts-node spore/7-leap-spore-to-btc.ts
```

## FAQ

If you have any questions, please refer to the FAQ first.

See [RGBPP FAQ](https://github.com/ckb-cell/rgbpp-sdk/wiki/RGBPP--FAQ)


## What you must know about BTC transaction id

**The BTC transaction id(hash) displayed on BTC explorer is different from the BTC transaction id(hash) in RGB++ lock args. They are in reverse byte order.**

We follow the following two rulesï¼š 

- Whenever you're working with transaction/block hashes **internally** (e.g. inside raw bitcoin data), you use the **natural** byte order.
- Whenever you're **displaying or searching** for transaction/block hashes, you use the **reverse** byte order.

For detailed rules, please refer to [Byte Order](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/general/byte-order/)

For example, the BTC transaction id(hash) of the RGB++ lock args like this: 

```
4abc778213bc4da692f93745c2b07410ef2bfaee70417784d4ee8969fb258001
```

But when you're searching for this transaction in [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/) or on a block explorer, you'll see this byte order:

```
018025fb6989eed484774170eefa2bef1074b0c24537f992a64dbc138277bc4a
```
